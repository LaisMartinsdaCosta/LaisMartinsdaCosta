In my professional career I have always sought to improve myself both on a technical and personal level.
As someone moved by many different forms of art, I personally believe in transdisciplinary projects as a means of social transformation. 
I seek to ally my dedication to education to my performance in both the field of researching and writing. 
In addition, being organized is part of my life - which makes my work more efficient and productive.
Due to being a continuous learner, I consider myself able to master new skills quickly, always being attentive to detail.
